When I was 10 we lived in New Jersey. My mother was in the process of becoming a contestant on the $20,000 Pyramid.She was taken aside and asked if she wanted to appear on the $20,000 Junior Pyramid. From October 1 to November 9, 1979, the series briefly became Junior Partner Pyramid, which scrapped the usual celebrity-contestant pairings in favor of children playing the game with a parent or other adult relative.\n\nIf youâ€™re curious what TV was like in 1979 then be all means watch the [episode](https://vimeo.com/26595314) the password is pa$$word. Oh and I lost the game.\n\n![Me and Mom](/assets/Me-Mom-2.jpg)\n\n\n![Contract](/assets/contract-6.jpg)\n\n\n![Pyramid](/assets/Pyramid-title.jpg)"}]
